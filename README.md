# Train-Scheduler

This is a train schedule application that incorporates 
Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves 
and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This app 
provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely 
their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they 
arrive at their station.
